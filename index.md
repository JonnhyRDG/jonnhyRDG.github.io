# Step 1: Exporting the XML file from Maya.**
Here's a snippet I got from chatGPT to export xml data with matrices from maya. 
It can be customized to export whatever you want from it, but you have to dig into it a bit.
I do have a custom code/api a TD did for me, but this is the gist of it.
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import maya.cmds as cmds

# Create the root element
root = ET.Element("Scene")

# Get a list of all objects in the scene
objects = cmds.ls(type="transform")

# Loop through each object and extract its matrix information
for obj in objects:
    matrix = cmds.xform(obj, q=True, matrix=True, ws=True)
    
    obj_element = ET.SubElement(root, "Object")
    obj_element.set("name", obj)
    
    matrix_element = ET.SubElement(obj_element, "Matrix")
    matrix_text = " ".join(str(value) for value in matrix)
    matrix_element.text = matrix_text

# Create an ElementTree and write to a file
tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
output_path = "output.xml"
tree.write(output_path)

print("XML exported successfully.")
```


Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
